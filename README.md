# Temperature-Converter

Created an application that allows the user to enter a temperature. The application has Button controls described as follows:

A button that reads Convert to Fahrenheit. If the user clicks this button, the application treats the temperature that is entered as a Celsius temperature and convert it to Fahrenheit.
A button reads Convert to Celsius. If the user clicks this button, the application treats the temperature that is entered as a Fahrenheit temperature, and convert it to Celsius.

Assuming that C is a Celsius temperature, the following formula converts the temperature to Fahrenheit:F = (9/5)C + 32
Assuming that F is a Fahrenheit temperature, the following formula converts the temperature to Celsius:C = (5/9)(F â€“32)
